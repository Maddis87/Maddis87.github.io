#### This is a little about me!

![a picture of Madelene Amberman riding a machine horse](/assets/monteMaddis.jpg)

I'm a mother of two kids, studying software engineering at Linnaeus University.  
I live with my family in a small place called Grimhult, there are also some animals living
with us, horses and cats.
On my spare time, which I don't have a lot of right now I'm trying to spend with my kids, work around with my horses or keep building our new stable.

Before i started study again I used to work in the security business, I've also worked with racinghorses in France before that so i don't have any computer programming skills sence before.
Which make all this about learning how to work with the computer by different programming languages totaly new for me, but I love it (for the moment:)) and think it's really fun. 

This was a cool little piece of me!
